## **Development Guidelines**

### **Branches**

- **`main` branch**: This is the production-ready code. All new features and bug fixes must be added to a feature branch, tested, and then merged into `main` via a pull request.
- **Feature Branches**: For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch with a descriptive name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### **Dependencies**

- Make sure to run `npm install` or `yarn install` after cloning the repo to get all required dependencies.
- If you add any new dependencies, update the `package.json` and lock files accordingly.

### **Testing**

- Ensure that you test any new functionality.
- Write unit tests for new components or functions and update existing tests if changes are made.
- Use the following command to run tests:

```bash
# For Expo (Mobile)
expo test

# For Next.js (Web)
npm run test
```

## **Pull Request Process**

1. **Create a Pull Request**: Once your work is ready, submit a pull request to the `main` branch.
   - Ensure that your pull request clearly describes the problem and solution.
   - Reference any relevant issues in your PR description.
   - If the changes affect UI, include before/after screenshots.
   
2. **Tests**: Ensure all existing tests pass, and write tests for your new feature.
   
3. **Code Review**: A project maintainer will review your pull request. You may be asked to make some changes based on feedback.
   
4. **Merge**: Once approved, your pull request will be merged. Ensure that your branch is up to date with `main` before merging.

## **Reporting Issues**

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Barazer-Improving-Citizen-Engagement/Bar0.0.0v/issues).

**When creating an issue:**
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the bug or describe the problem.
- Include relevant screenshots, code snippets, or error logs.

## **Style Guidelines**

### **Code Style**

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Follow the ES6+ standards for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **React Components**: Use function components over class components.
- **Formatting**: Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format your code. The repository has a `.prettierrc` file with the preferred configurations.

### **File and Folder Structure**

- Use PascalCase for component files and camelCase for function/variable names.
- Organize components in the `components/` directory and page-specific logic in `pages/`.
  
### **CSS/Styling**

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling in the Next.js web app.
- Follow the existing style and utility classes to maintain consistency.
